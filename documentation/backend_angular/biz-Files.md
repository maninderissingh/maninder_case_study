## FrameWorks & technology.
Online Calendar is built in angular 1.6 for frontend.
For Backend APIs Yii2 is used.


## Basic Setup Folder

__/root__ folder is responsible to handle all Online Calendar setup level functions. 

Inside this we have these subfolders:
- vendor - Store Thrid Party Plugins
- JS - All JS files & third party Libraries are in JS folder. This project is based on `angular 1.6`. Front related `JS` files are in __\app__ folder. `app/js/controller.js` is the main file that is used in mostly pages.

- CSS - Css files are in __/css__ and also in __app/css__ folders.
- HTML - HTML files are in __/app/pages__ and __/app/views__ folders.
         for preview 3 templates we have 3 different files, `Online Calendar_preview_htm_1.php`,`Online Calendar_preview_htm_2.php` and `Online Calendar_preview_htm_3.php`.
